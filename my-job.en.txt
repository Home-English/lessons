My last work place is a Blockchain project;
( At my last work place I do a Blockchain project )
The blockchain project was the startup;
The blockchaine project has a microservice architector.
At the project I had many different and interest tasks.
One of many my task I had develop the register service.
And also I had a user wallet of microservice.
And also I took part to at another tasks, for example install and configuration the project platform.
And at the project I integrate new technologies, for example: the kafka, the two factor authentication, the SMS-message dispatch (с помощью API-провайдера).
I promouted install and configure tools that build and deploy this microservices to our platform.
At the project I acquaint the JHipster platform, and I learned to generate and deploy some new microservice.
The project has next technologies as: the java eight, the spring boot two, the jhipster five, the react, the kafka, the angular five, the postgresql database.
At the project has the junit test, the mock unittest and the integrational test.
Our team has twelve developer men.
It has five member a backend developers, two member a frontend developers, two member a technical consultants, one member a lead our team, one member a project manager, two member a analyst and two member a testers people.
At work process to our team has scram system.
Everyday we had daily meetings.
And we had a two weeks of sprint.
Our sprints had people from our team and independed people from customer side.
Every tasks has several phase that it do full complete.
- Our business analyst provide the asserted requirements by project from customer to us.
- The begin process our team discuss the architectural model of project.
- Next time our lead member created specific tasks that was according the requirements by sprint.
- And next time our team estimated every task;
- Our project manager prepared the list tasks on the next phase of sprint;
- The start of new sprint give out tasks of the sprint (или можно было взять задачу по желанию или тим-лид мог назначить задачу на разработчика);
- After implemented task developer must coverage a junit test for a task's code and to pass on code review.
- (код-ревью могли просматривать паралельно несколько разработчиков) Only after get successfully agreement the code review then the task turn to on test people;
- как правило тестирование немного опаздывало от разработки, поэтому чтобы укладываться за графиком спринты немного сдвигали чтобы успевать тестировать;
- And after successfully test completed the task turn on product - and it was the finish phase.
